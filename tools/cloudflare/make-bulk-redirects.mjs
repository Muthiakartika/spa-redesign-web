/**
 * Write tools/cloudflare/bulk-redirects.csv, a Cloudflare Bulk Redirect list
 * made from the website's own redirect map (liveRedirects in
 * src/data/redirects.ts), so old URLs reach their final address in one hop
 * for http as well as https, on www as well as spabalimoon.com.
 *
 *   npm run cloudflare:redirects
 *
 * Then upload the CSV to the Bulk Redirect list in Cloudflare (replacing the
 * old entries). Run it again whenever liveRedirects changes.
 *
 * Why Cloudflare: http:// requests are sent to https:// (Vercel, 308) before
 * next.config.ts runs, so http://www.spabalimoon.com/old-page/ took two hops.
 * Cloudflare answers before that.
 *
 * Every line uses Subpath matching, without the trailing slash, so
 * /old-page, /old-page/ and /old-page/anything all match, and so that the
 * documented "most specific path wins" rule always picks an old URL's line
 * over the last line (any other www URL → the same path on spabalimoon.com).
 * Line format (no header row): source, target, status, preserve query string,
 * include subdomains, subpath matching, preserve path suffix.
 *
 * Each old URL gets one line for spabalimoon.com and one for www, never
 * "include subdomains": that also matches images.spabalimoon.com (the R2
 * bucket), where /blog → /guide sent every uploaded article photo
 * (blog/<name>.webp) to a 404.
