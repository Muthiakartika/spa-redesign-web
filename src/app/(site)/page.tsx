/**
 * Homepage — the owner's redesign, the "v3" draft made the homepage on
 * 1 October (the live-port homepage it replaced is in git). It is the v2
 * layout (src/components/home/HomeLayout.tsx) with treatments option 1
 * (all 23 treatments in a row that scrolls sideways) and price-list option A
 * (one duration switch sets every price, and stays under the header down the
 * list), plus the owner's changes: the slider, menu and About headings in the
 * owner's words, a plain grey FAQ arrow, tighter spacing in places, and the
 * owner's gold #B88C35, logos included (src/styles/gold.css; site-wide since
 * 1 October).
 * /home-v3/ now redirects here; the other drafts stay as they are.
