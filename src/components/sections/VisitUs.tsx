 * `treatment` is how the heading names it: "Where Can I Book {treatment} in
 * Seminyak?", e.g. "Balinese Massage", "a Facial".
 *
 * "Visit us" on every treatment page and the About page (AEO roadmap R17 and
 * R40, 17 Oct): the address, the hours, in the spa or at your villa, the home
 * service fee and the booking line, in the page itself rather than only in
 * the header and footer, with links to the villa, home service and price
 * pages. Every fact comes from src/data/business.ts, so the pages never
 * disagree. Added by the treatment page template, not the page's tree: the
 * admin does not need to keep it.
 *
 * The looks follow luxury spa sites (Four Seasons Sayan, Belmond): the facts
 * as label and value rows on gold hairlines, one gold button and a text link.
 *  split  a spa photo across half the width, beside a warm paper panel
 *         (default, tried 17 Oct)
 *  light  the heading centred on white (17 Oct; a dark band was turned down)
 * A frangipani and a leaf hang over the card's corners, as on the theme's
 * other sections (owner, 17 Oct).
 *
 * `look="columns"` (all treatment pages; owner, 19 Oct: the plain rows said
 * too much, white tiles looked templated, and a card over the photo hid the
 * therapist; of three tries the owner kept this): no photo, a paper-coloured
 * panel with the heading and the answer centred, then the four facts in
 * columns between gold hairlines, each under its gold icon in a white
 * circle (address, hours, booking, villa fee); the price list link goes
 * beside the button, where "Get directions" was (the address keeps that
 * link). Two columns on tablets, one on phones.
 *
 * `look="photo"` (About page, 19 Oct): the same facts and buttons, two by
 * two, beside the split look's photo, so the therapist stays in view.
