    {
      question: "1. How do I choose the right treatment?",
      answer: "Start with what you want from your visit. At Spa Bali Moon, Balinese Massage (IDR 159.000 for 1 hour) is popular for general relaxation, while Sports Massage and Deep Tissue Massage (both IDR 269.000 for 1 hour) suit muscle tightness and recovery. Our team can also recommend a treatment based on how you feel."
    },
    {
      question: "2. Can I combine several treatments into one visit?",
      answer: "Yes. At Spa Bali Moon, massage, facials, body scrubs, cream baths, manicures, pedicures, and other services can be combined through our spa packages or selected treatment combinations. Packages start at IDR 299.000 per person, and a 1-hour Balinese Massage with a 30-minute manicure and 30-minute pedicure is IDR 399.000 per person."
    },
    {
      question: "3. Are the prices listed for each treatment?",
      answer: "Yes. Every treatment and package on the Spa Bali Moon price list has its price listed, in Indonesian rupiah (IDR), with each duration priced separately. For example, Balinese massage is IDR 159.000 for 1 hour, IDR 239.000 for 1.5 hours and IDR 330.000 for 2 hours. Home service adds IDR 75.000 per therapist."
    },
    {
      question: "4. Can I book a treatment at my hotel or villa?",
      answer: "Yes. Many Spa Bali Moon massage and spa treatments are available as home service at your hotel or villa in Seminyak and nearby areas, such as Kerobokan, Petitenget, Canggu and North Kuta. An extra IDR 75.000 per therapist applies on top of the treatment price. Send your location and preferred time on WhatsApp to book."
    },
    {
      question: "5. Can I create a custom spa package?",
      answer: "Yes. If you have several treatments in mind, contact Spa Bali Moon through WhatsApp and our team can help you find a combination that suits your preferences, schedule, and budget. For ideas, browse our ready-made packages, which combine treatments such as Balinese massage, Thai massage, facials, cream baths, body scrubs and manicures."
    },
    {
      question: "6. Do I need to book in advance?",
      answer: "Advance booking is recommended at Spa Bali Moon, particularly during busy periods, although walk-ins are welcome at our Seminyak spa. Contact us on WhatsApp at +62 878-6317-5144 with your preferred treatment and time so we can check availability. Same-day home service is often possible, depending on therapist availability."
    },
    {
      question: "7. What currency are the prices in?",
      answer: "All prices at Spa Bali Moon are in Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), with a dot as the thousands separator. For example, IDR 159.000 is one hundred and fifty-nine thousand rupiah, the price of a one-hour Balinese massage. The same IDR prices apply at our Seminyak spa and for home service, plus the outcall fee."
    },
    {
      question: "8. What is your cheapest treatment?",
      answer: "The lowest price on the Spa Bali Moon menu is IDR 69.000 for nail colour on feet or hands. For massage, the lowest-priced options are the 30-minute traditional massage and 30-minute back massage at IDR 90.000. For a full hour, Balinese massage at IDR 159.000 is the most affordable full-body treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "9. Are prices per person or per booking?",
      answer: "At Spa Bali Moon, individual treatments and spa packages are priced per person. Couple treatments are priced for two people together; the \"2 pax\" label means the listed price covers both guests. For example, a one-hour couple Balinese massage at IDR 319.000 is the total for two people, not per person."
    },
    {
      question: "10. How much extra is home service?",
      answer: "Spa Bali Moon home service costs an additional IDR 75.000 per therapist on top of the treatment price. Treatments cost the same as in-spa, so a one-hour Balinese massage is IDR 159.000 in the spa and IDR 234.000 at your villa. For a couple booking with two therapists, the outcall fee is IDR 150.000 total."
    },
    {
      question: "11. Which areas do you cover for outcall massage?",
      answer: "Spa Bali Moon covers Seminyak and surrounding areas, including Kerobokan, Petitenget, Canggu and North Kuta. We also travel to Kuta, Jimbaran, Uluwatu, Nusa Dua, Sanur, Denpasar and Ubud, subject to therapist availability and travel time. Message us on WhatsApp with your location and we will confirm availability and any additional travel cost before you book."
    },
    {
      question: "12. Is tipping expected?",
      answer: "Tipping is not required at Spa Bali Moon and is never added automatically, whether you visit our Seminyak spa or book home service at your villa or hotel. A tip is appreciated but entirely at your discretion, and our therapists are paid regardless of whether you leave one or not."
    },
    {
      question: "13. Do prices differ between the website and in the spa?",
      answer: "No. The prices listed on the Spa Bali Moon website are our current rates and apply both in our Seminyak spa and for home service, with the outcall fee of IDR 75.000 per therapist added separately for home visits. If you are ever quoted a different price, please tell us before your treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "14. Are towels, oils, and amenities included?",
      answer: "Yes. Every treatment at our Seminyak spa includes clean towels, professional-grade massage oil, and use of a private treatment room, with no additional charge for amenities. For home service, the Spa Bali Moon therapist brings a portable massage bed, freshly laundered linens and towels, and massage oils, so you do not need to supply anything."
    },
    {
      question: "15. Can I choose the pressure or a specific therapist?",
      answer: "Yes. Tell your Spa Bali Moon therapist your preferred pressure at the start and adjust it at any point during the session. For firmer pressure, try Deep Tissue Massage or Traditional Massage (Strong). If you have a therapist you have booked before, request them by name on WhatsApp and we will do our best to accommodate."
    },
    {
      question: "16. How can I pay for my treatment?",
      answer: "Spa Bali Moon accepts Visa, Mastercard and cash. All prices are in Indonesian rupiah (IDR) and are the same at our Seminyak spa and for home service, where the IDR 75.000 per therapist fee is added. For payment questions, especially about home service, message us on WhatsApp at +62 878-6317-5144 before your treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "17. What are your opening hours?",
