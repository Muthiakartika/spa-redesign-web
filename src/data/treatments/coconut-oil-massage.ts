        question: "What makes virgin cold-pressed coconut oil different from regular massage oil?",
        answer: "Virgin cold-pressed coconut oil is extracted without high heat, helping preserve its natural composition. Many people prefer it because it feels lightweight on the skin and provides natural moisture during the massage.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this massage suitable for sensitive skin?",
        answer: "For most people, yes. Virgin coconut oil is generally well tolerated, but if you have allergies to coconut or specific skin concerns, please let us know before your appointment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will the massage leave my skin feeling oily?",
        answer: "A light layer of oil may remain immediately after the session, but much of the oil is absorbed during the massage, leaving the skin feeling soft and comfortable.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I book this massage as a home service?",
        answer: "Yes. This treatment is available at our spa as well as through our villa and hotel home service throughout Seminyak and nearby areas.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this massage only for relaxation?",
        answer: "Relaxation is one of its main benefits, but many guests also choose this treatment because the virgin coconut oil helps keep the skin feeling soft, smooth, and moisturised.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is virgin coconut oil massage suitable for dry skin?",
        answer: "It can be a suitable option for people with dry or dehydrated-feeling skin because coconut oil helps moisturise and soften the skin. However, individual skin types can respond differently to oils, so guests with known sensitivities should inform their therapist before treatment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can virgin coconut oil massage help with muscle tension?",
        answer: "The massage techniques used during the treatment can help relax tight or tired muscles and promote an overall sense of physical relaxation. The benefits depend on the massage pressure, techniques used, and individual needs rather than the coconut oil itself.",
