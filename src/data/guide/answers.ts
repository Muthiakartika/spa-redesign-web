/**
 * GUIDE ARTICLES: the short answer shown above each article's text.
 *
 * AEO roadmap (R32, R59, R69, 17 Oct 2026): every guide article opens with
 * two sentences that name Spa Bali Moon, give the price and link to the
 * treatment page, so an AI answer quoting the article also finds the spa.
 * The texts are the drafts in migration/copy-rewrite-2026-10.md. They live
 * here, not in the article body in the database, so no article needs to be
 * edited in /admin/ for them; an article without an entry shows no box
 * (IV Drip, the two articles added on live on 14 Oct 2026, and any new article
 * until a line is added here).
 *
 * Write a link as [words](/address/). Prices: keep them equal to the price list.
