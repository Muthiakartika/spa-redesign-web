const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "What is an outcall massage?",
    answer:
      "An outcall massage is a professional treatment delivered by a therapist who travels to you, rather than you visiting the spa. Our therapists come to your villa, hotel room, or private residence with everything needed for the session. It is also known as home service, home massage, mobile massage or massage on call.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to prepare anything?",
    answer:
      "No. Our therapists bring the massage bed, clean linens, towels, and oils. All you need is a space of roughly two by two metres; a bedroom, terrace or living area all work well. If you have a preference for where the session takes place, tell us when you book.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the therapist bring?",
    answer:
      "A Spa Bali Moon outcall therapist brings a portable massage bed, freshly laundered linens and towels, professional massage oils, and any equipment specific to your chosen treatment. Nothing is reused between guests. You do not need to supply towels, sheets, or anything else; just leave a space of roughly two by two metres.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer:
      "Setup takes around five to ten minutes when your therapist arrives, and a similar time to pack down afterwards. Your treatment time begins once setup is complete, so a booked 60-minute massage at your villa or hotel is a full 60 minutes of treatment, at the spa price plus IDR 75.000 per therapist.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which areas do you cover for home service?",
    answer:
      "Our spa is in Seminyak, and home service is available across Seminyak, Kerobokan, Petitenget, Canggu, and North Kuta. We also travel to Kuta, Jimbaran, Uluwatu, Nusa Dua, Sanur, Denpasar, and Ubud, subject to therapist availability and travel time. Message us with your location and we will confirm. See [our home service areas](#areas) for more detail.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my hotel doesn't allow outside therapists?",
    answer:
      "Some hotels and resorts restrict external therapists, particularly larger properties with their own spa. Please check with reception before booking. Private villas and guesthouses rarely have this restriction. If your property does not permit home service, you are very welcome at [our Seminyak spa](/seminyak/day-spa/) instead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which massage is best after a long flight?",
    answer:
      "A one-hour Balinese or aromatherapy massage suits most guests arriving in Bali. Both use steady, flowing pressure rather than deep work, which helps with circulation and sleep after a long journey. Foot reflexology is a good shorter option if your legs and feet feel swollen. Read more in our [jet lag recovery guide](/guide/jet-lag-recovery-best-treatments-after-a-long-flight/).",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a home service massage cost in Seminyak?",
    answer:
      "The treatment price plus IDR 75.000 per therapist. A 60-minute Balinese massage at your villa in Seminyak is IDR 159.000 + IDR 75.000 = IDR 234.000. Couples treatments use two therapists, so the fee is IDR 150.000. See [home service prices](#home-service-prices).",
  },
  // Copy rewrite, 15 Oct (kept: it is the page's one answer about how soon a therapist arrives).
  {
    question: "Can I book an outcall massage on the same day?",
    answer:
      "Often, yes, depending on therapist availability. Send your location and preferred time on WhatsApp at +62 878-6317-5144, between 9am and 11pm, and we'll confirm when a therapist can arrive. In Seminyak and nearby areas therapists usually arrive within 30 to 60 minutes; for a fixed time or several therapists, book earlier in the day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I book a late-night massage at my villa?",
    // C8 (the latest start time for a 60-minute treatment) is added here once the owner confirms it.
    answer: "Yes. Home service runs daily until 11pm.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we book a couples massage at our villa or hotel?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Two therapists arrive together and set up side by side, so you're both treated at the same time. Couples massage starts from IDR 319.000 for 60 minutes, plus IDR 75.000 per therapist.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I ask for a female or male therapist?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Tell us your preference when you book and we'll arrange a female or male therapist.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I pay for a home service massage?",
    answer:
      "You pay your therapist after the treatment, in cash or by card. Your therapist brings a card machine, and we accept Visa and Mastercard.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is your outcall massage a professional service?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We are a licensed day spa in Seminyak, open since 2009, and we offer professional relaxation and therapeutic massage only. Our team confirms every home service booking on WhatsApp.",
