                question: "What is an outcall massage?",
                answer:
                  "An outcall massage is a professional treatment delivered by a therapist who travels to you, rather than you visiting the spa. Our therapists come to your villa, hotel room, or private residence with everything needed for the session. It is also known as home service or mobile massage.",
              },
              {
                question: "Do I need to prepare anything?",
                answer:
                  "No. Our therapists bring the massage bed, clean linens, towels, and oils. All you need is a space of roughly two by two metres and a bedroom, terrace, or living area all work well. If you have a preference for where the session takes place, tell us when you book.",
              },
              {
                question: "What does the therapist bring?",
                answer:
                  "A portable massage bed, freshly laundered linens and towels, professional massage oils, and any equipment specific to your chosen treatment. Nothing is reused between guests. You do not need to supply towels, sheets, or anything else.",
              },
              {
                question: "How long does setup take?",
                answer:
                  "Around five to ten minutes on arrival, and a similar time to pack down afterwards. Your treatment time begins once setup is complete, so a booked 60-minute massage is a full 60 minutes of treatment.",
              },
              {
                question: "Which areas do you cover for home service?",
                answer:
                  "Our spa is in Seminyak, and home service is available across Seminyak, Kerobokan, Petitenget, Canggu, and North Kuta. We also travel to Kuta, Jimbaran, Uluwatu, Nusa Dua, Sanur, Denpasar, and Ubud, subject to therapist availability and travel time. Message us with your location and we will confirm.",
              },
              {
                question: "What if my hotel doesn't allow outside therapists?",
                answer:
                  "Some hotels and resorts restrict external therapists, particularly larger properties with their own spa. Please check with reception before booking. Private villas and guesthouses rarely have this restriction. If your property does not permit home service, you are very welcome at our Seminyak spa instead.",
              },
              {
                question: "Which massage is best after a long flight?",
                answer:
                  "A one-hour Balinese or aromatherapy massage suits most guests arriving in Bali. Both use steady, flowing pressure rather than deep work, which helps with circulation and sleep after a long journey. Foot reflexology is a good shorter option if your legs and feet feel swollen.",
